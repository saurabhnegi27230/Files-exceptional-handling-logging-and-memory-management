        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Difference between interpreted and compiled languages\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpreted: Code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter (e.g., Python, JavaScript). Slower execution but easier debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compiled: Code is converted into machine code before execution (e.g., C, C++). Faster execution but needs recompilation after changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A mechanism to handle runtime errors gracefully without crashing the program, using try, except, else, and finally blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Purpose of the finally block\n",
        "\n",
        "It contains code that will always run, regardless of whether an exception occurred—commonly used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A way to track events and messages in a program for debugging and monitoring, using the logging module.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Significance of the __del__ method\n",
        "\n",
        "It is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed, used to release resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Difference between import and from ... import\n",
        "\n",
        "import module → You must use module.function().\n",
        "\n",
        "from module import function → You can call function() directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Handling multiple exceptions\n",
        "\n",
        "Use multiple except blocks for different exception types or a single except (Type1, Type2): to catch multiple at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Purpose of the with statement in file handling\n",
        "\n",
        "It automatically manages opening and closing files, ensuring resources are released even if an error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Difference between multithreading and multiprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "Multithreading: Multiple threads share the same memory space (good for I/O-bound tasks).\n",

        "Multiprocessing: Multiple processes have separate memory (good for CPU-bound tasks).\n",

        "\n",
        "It prevents memory leaks, optimizes performance, and ensures efficient use of system resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Role of try and except\n",
        "\n",

        "15. How Python’s garbage collection works\n",
        "\n",
        "It uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to remove unused objects from memory.\n",

        "16. Purpose of the else block in exception handling\n",
        "\n",

        "DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. Difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "os.fork() → Unix-only, creates a new process identical to the current one.\n",
        "\n",
        "multiprocessing → Cross-platform module that creates and manages separate processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Importance of closing a file\n",
        "\n",
        "Releases system resources, ensures data is written to disk, and avoids file corruption.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Difference between file.read() and file.readline()\n",
        "\n",
        "read() → Reads the entire file or specified bytes.\n",

        "Used to create logs with different severity levels and save them to files or output streams.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. Purpose of os module in file handling\n",
        "\n",
        "Provides functions for interacting with the operating system, like file/directory creation, deletion, and path operations.\n",

        "Use raise ExceptionType(\"message\"). Example:\n",
        "raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\")\n",
